Description:
Our application provides users with deals at local bars across college campuses. The deals show Happy Hour listings and specials offered by an app on a given night. Users have to ability to sort the bar listing based on different criterias such as how Crowded, Prices, Music, Vibe. The crowded criterion allows users to distinguish between crowded and empty bars. The price criterion allows users to sort by different price ranges of drinks at a given bar. The music criterion allows users to filter to bars that play specific types of music. The vibe criterion allows users to Check-in and informs other app users of the vibe at a bar at a given time. The check-in feature also allows users to report where they are similar to the feature offered by Four Square. The app is designed to give users a personalized experience by sorting and filtering based on their inputs for each criteria.
